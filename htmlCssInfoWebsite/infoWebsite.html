            <h1 class="header" id="bruh" >Where to start?</h1>
            <p>You should start with finding a few youtube videos or websites to help you learn.
            Some good youtubers are SuperSimpleDev and Programming with Mosh.
            A few websites that you can learn from are freecodecamp and codecademy.</p>
            <h1 class="header">Which first?</h1>
            <p>Instead of learning one first, or one at a time. You should learn both at the same time as they go hand in hand!</p>
            <h1 class="header">Best resources</h1>
            <p>Some of the best resources I've found are stack overflow and w3schools.</p>
            <h1 class="header">Basic HTML</h1>
            <p>Basic HTML code for a paragraph is defined by a <code>p</code> tag. </p>
            <h1 class="header">Basic CSS</h1>
            <p>To target an tag in CSS you need to type the name of the tag such a <code>p</code> and then put {} after it. Then you can type in your designs such as <code>color:blue</code> to make the text color blue</p>
